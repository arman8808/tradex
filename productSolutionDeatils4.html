        <h2>Angles, Channels, Slotted Channels!</h2>
        <p>
            We specialize in providing and exporting an extensive array of Stainless Steel Angles and Stainless Steel Channels, along with Mild Steel I Beams and Mild Steel H Beams. Moreover, in order to cater to diverse needs across various applications, we present these SS Angles and SS Channels in a wide range of sizes, grades, types, and other specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our comprehensive selection of Stainless Steel Angles & Channels caters to a variety of industrial and commercial sectors. These products come in different dimensions for leg height, width, material thickness, and other relevant parameters.
        </p>
        <p>At TradeX Greens, we offer Stainless Steel Beams that can be customized to any length up to 6 meters. Our inventory includes various sizes and types of stainless steel angles, including those with uneven sides as well as equal sides. These products are available in multiple stainless steel grades, such as 304, 304L, 310, 310S, 316, 316L, 316Ti, 317, 317L, 321, 321H, 347, 347H, 13-8 PH, 15-5 PH, 17-4 PH, and more.</p>
       <p>Referred to as a strut channel, the slotted channel serves as a metal bracket utilized for providing support to ducting. The slotted channel framework consists of a perforated metal base, enabling its attachment to different surfaces including concrete, walls, ceilings, floors, and even steel structures. This is achieved using specialized bolts and various fasteners, such as fittings in Z or U shapes. The slotted channel is typically fabricated from 12-14 gauge galvanized sheet metal, but it can also be found with alternative finishes like paint, powder coat, or epoxy. Other variations include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
        Stainless steel slotted channels - employed in scenarios where preventing rust is crucial, such as outdoor settings, construction sites exposed to corrosive environments, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
        Fiberglass slotted channels - used in extremely corrosive settings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Aluminum alloy - utilized when the weight of the attached object is a concern.
        </li>
       </ul> 
       <p>The prevailing industry standard for slotted channels is MFMA-4. These channels are available in two types: heavy and light (2.5mm and 1.5mm) and are typically sold in standard 3-meter lengths.</p>
       <p>The primary benefit of the slotted metal channel lies in its ability to facilitate rapid and straightforward connections between components. Its availability in various lengths and sizes allows for versatile application in a multitude of situations. Furthermore, their installation requires only moderately skilled labor, making them one of the most cost-effective solutions in the market. Slotted channels are exceptionally versatile, and their installation can be adjusted relatively easily.</p>
       <h5>Diverse Selection of Beam Clamps!</h5>

        <p>
            Beam clamps, also known as girder clamps, see extensive use in construction sites, industrial buildings, and warehouses. They serve the purpose of attaching electrical wires and pipelines to beams or girders. These clamps are employed for support, linking different components without the necessity of drilling or welding. Steel beam clamps can function as both temporary and permanent connections, facilitating the creation of joints between beams and more. Below, you will find our assortment of bolted beam clamps.
        </p>
        <p>Typically, steel beam clamps are engineered to attach to specific components like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        Roofing or flooring panels
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondary beams
          </li>
          <li>
            Locating plates
          </li>
          <li>
            Threaded rods, conduits, or pipes
          </li>
        
        </ul>
        <p>
            Manufactured primarily from stainless steel, iron, and steel, beam clamps are available in various finishes to enhance their durability.
